# Thea
Self-hosted web-based thesaurus written in Python 3. Fork of [Synonym-web](https://github.com/andyforceno/synonym-web). I didn't want to rely on an external API, so here we are. I also removed a lot of things to make the interface more minimal.

With Thea you can: query for words in your browser and get synonyms. It also offers spelling suggestions for mispelled words


## Installation:
    git clone https://github.com/DUOLabs333/thea.git
    ./thea/thea
    Browse to http://localhost:5000 (can be changed with environment variable PORT)
